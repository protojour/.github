# Protojour

We are an independent software studio building software alternatives.


## Principles

### ASLPAP ethos
> As…  Simple | Lightweight | Performant  … as possible

### Linux & Open Source
The only way to dress a server is in a tux.
With high performance, responsive, open source software. 

### Green Code
We love Rust as it lets us write code with confidence that what we deliver works as intended. 
Writing base capability modules in Rust has added benefit of being simple, lightweight and performant which in turn reduces the need for cpu cycles and hardware.
As the energy consumption of data centers are climbing due to cloud deployments of low quality high level software, we want to turn the trend around and make it so that everyone who builds Situ Platform solutions contributes to lower footprint software.

## Activities
### [The Situ Project](https://github.com/protojour/situ/wiki)

The Situ project builds fundamental capabilities for next generation software platforms

Software systems is becoming an integral part of the world around us and they are growing ever more critical and complex. 
This pushes the expectations of system quality up and raises the bar for what software developers must be able to continuously deliver while sustaining the level of feature functionality.

We believe in a base capability architecture where the platforms provide common functionality that let developers focus on feature logic and user experience.

#### Components
##### Situ Platform - Service Platform
The Situ Platform is a development and software service accelerator. Allowing you to focus on feature logic and user experience, while trusting backend api and performance to the platform capabilities.

##### Authly - Digital Identity
Authly is a security modeling engine where you describe your security domain. It builds a secure Arx with a gateway that manages IAM for your software services.

##### Memoriam - Core Domain Services
Memoriam is a service mesh and domain engine that manages your data ontology state. It uses Authly to build trust networks and solutions using modules and bundles and can act as a central information repository.
