# Protojour

We are an independent software studio building software alternatives.

## Principles

### ASLPAP ethos

As...  Simple | Lightweight | Performant  ...as possible

### Linux & Open Source

The only way to dress a server is in a tux -- with high performance, responsive, open source software. 

### Green Code

We love Rust because it allows us to write code with the confidence that our delivery will work as intended. Writing base capability modules in Rust offers the added benefit of being both lightweight and highly performant, thereby reducing CPU, memory, and bandwidth requirements. As energy consumption in data centers is rising due to cloud deployments of low-quality, high-level software, we aim to reverse this trend by encouraging everyone to build Situ Platform solutions and contribute to developing more efficient, lower-footprint software.

## Activities

### [The Situ Project](https://github.com/protojour/situ/wiki)

The Situ project builds fundamental capabilities for next generation software platforms.

Software systems are an integral part of the world around us, and they are growing ever more critical and complex. This increases expectations for system quality and raises the bar for what software developers must continuously deliver while maintaining high levels of feature functionality.

We believe in a base capability architecture where the platform provides common functionality that lets developers focus on feature logic and user experience.

#### Components

##### Situ Platform - Service Platform

[The Situ Platform](https://protojour.github.io/situ/) is a development and software service accelerator, allowing you to focus on feature logic and user experience, while entrusting backend security and core performance to the platform.

##### Authly - Digital Identity

Authly is a security modeling engine where you describe your security domain. It employs a secure Arx gateway and manages Identity and Access Management (IAM) for your software services.

##### Memoriam - Core Domain Services

Memoriam is a service mesh and domain engine that manages your data ontology. It uses Authly to establish trust networks, and acts as a central information repository for your services.
